These are WINDOWS binaries for 32-bit Python 2.7.
---------------------------

It is best to install openpiv-INSTALL first. 
If modules are still missing (according to Python runtime), install PythonXY at: 
https://code.google.com/p/pythonxy/wiki/Downloads?tm=2

After fully installing python xy (install regardless of warnings), re-install cython, numpy, scipy, and tables.
(Re-install whatever modules show up with errors).
